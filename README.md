Hi there, I’m Numan!

13 y/o developer with a passion for building cool stuff

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a self-taught developer who loves experimenting with web development, scripting, and full-stack projects. Even though I’m only 13, I’ve already spent a lot of time coding and learning new technologies, and I’m always working on something new!

🛠️ Tech I Use
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Backend: Python, PHP
	•	Databases: MySQL
	•	Other Tools & Libraries:
	•	Playwright (for automation & scraping)
	•	Discord.js (for bots)
	•	Flask (web apps with Python)
	•	Vosk (speech recognition)
	•	and more…

📁 What You’ll Find Here
	•	APIs – Like my vehicle lookup and Sparx Maths API projects
	•	Web Scrapers – Smart bots that fetch real data from websites
	•	Discord Bots – Helpful tools with real-world uses
	•	Custom Tools – Projects that solve my own problems or automate tasks

💡 Fun Projects I’m Working On
	•	Building my own AI voice assistant
	•	Creating my own operating system in Assembly and C
	•	Dual-booting Linux with Windows and customizing the bootloader
	•	Making a Chrome extension that links to an iOS app

🌱 Always Learning

I’m always looking for ways to improve and learn more, especially about backend development, automation, and low-level programming (like OS dev and Assembly). I love experimenting with new technologies and pushing myself to do things most people wouldn’t expect from someone my age.
